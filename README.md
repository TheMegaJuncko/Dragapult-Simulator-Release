This is the public repository of Dragapult Simulator, where every releases will be updated.

Dragapult Simulator is a software for Windows and Mac that is made to facilitate damage calculations and checking for break/bulkpoint by making calculations against multiple IV combinations (up to all 4096) of a same pokemon. From straight 1v1's to comparing different IV spreads of one pokemon against the whole meta, all the way to damage ranges for a specific combinations of moves (as well as a rank checker), Dragapult Simulator is the ultimate tool for theorycrafting and IV shenanigans.

You may find that this folder doesn't contain any installers. At the time this readme is written (12/08/2025), the simulator has not reached the state of beta. Please look forward to more informations on release dates.
